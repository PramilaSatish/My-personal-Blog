    <p><u>Pichwai Paintings </u> are a traditional style of Indian painting that originated in the state of 
        Rajasthan in the 17th century. These paintings are characterized by their intricate details,
         bright colors, and depictions of Lord Krishna's life and teachings.Pichhwai (also pichwai,
          pichhavai, pichhvai, pechhavai etc), literally meaning 'that which hangs from the back' 
          from the Sanskrit words "Pichh" means back and "wais" means hanging, are large <u>devotional
            Hindu painted pictures,</u> normally on cloth, which portray Krishna. They are mainly made
            to hang in Hindu temples of the Pushtimarg devotional tradition, especially the <u>
            Shrinathji Temple in Nathdwara, Rajasthan,</u> built around 1672. They are hung behind the
             idol of Shrinathji, a local form of Krishna and the centre of Pushtimarg worship, to
              depict his leelas. Aurangabad was another area associated with them.The purpose of
               pichhwais, other than artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate.
                Temples have sets with different images, which are changed according to the calendar of
                 festivals celebrating the deity.</p></div>
                 <div class="B"><div class="a"><p>
                    The main image portrayed in Pichhwai paintings is Shrinathji. This 700+ years 
                    old form of Krishna, is the presiding deity worshipped at the<u> Shrinathji Temple</u>
                     with many paintings showing the rituals and worship offered to the deity in the
                      temple. Modern pichhwais may also portray other forms of Krishna worshipped in
                       the Pushtimarg tradition such as<u> Dwarkadish,</u> the presiding deity at the
                        Dwarkadish Temple. Whilst these paintings focus on Shrinathji, paintings 
                        often depicts other deities in the tradition such as Yamunaji, Goswamis such
                         as Vallabhacharya and other priests.

                            Pichhwais have two main functions within the Pushtimarg Sampradaya. 
                            Ones used as backdrops on the inner sanctums in the shrines, they are
                            changed daily and are designed in accordance to the season, festival and 
                            rituals of that day. Other pichhwais are artists documentation of the 
                            worship in the faith. Each festival and ritual within the faith is an 
                            elaborate affair with a pichhwai showcasing the adornment, emotions, mood,
                             music, food and dancing that encompasses the worship. With daily 
                             worship of Shrinathji having 8 different formal viewings, pichhwais may 
                             often depict the eight different adornments associated with each viewing.
                              Festivals such as Govardhan Puja, Sharad Purnima, Raslila, Holi 
                              alongside other prominent festivals in Pushtimarg are depicted with 
                              vivid detail on the modes of worship and the items used. These Pichwais 
                              often also as a historical documentation on how and who participated in 
                              these festival throughout the doctrine's history.

                    <h2>16th - 19th Century</h2>
                    <p>In 1672CE when the Shrinathji temple was established, Vitthalnath the chief
                         priest and son of the Pushitmarg sect founder Vallabhachrya, employed 
                         artisans under the temple administration to create pichhwais. These were
                          traditionally made by the artisans only on commission by the chief priest 
                          for religious worship and ceremonies.[7] However in the coming centuries, 
                          as the sect grew to various part of India such as Gujarat and Mathura, the 
                          art styles reached those places as well. Pichhwais were made to be taken by
                           pilgrims from Shrinathji temple but were also commissioned by wealthy 
                           families. The heavy and intricate nature of this art also led to its 
                           favour by theatre companies, with production companies commissioning as
                            backdrops for productions.  </p>

                            <p>
                                The start of the century had westernised art school painting forms 
                                gaining more preferability to the Indian business and upper classes
                                 compared to traditional styles such as pichhwai. To increase 
                                 pichhwai demand, artisans started to make slight shifts in their 
                                 painting techniques. pichwais were made both in the traditional 
                                 style, but also started to incorporate western influences such as
                                  using oil paints and using realism rather than the traditional
                                   stylistic approach. One example is that the feet drawn in these
                                    paintings, particularity that of Shrinathji, were drawn with the
                                     western art technique of Foreshortening rather than the 
                                     traditional portrayal of feet being sideways. However, this time
                                      period also had heavy influence from political movements such 
                                      as the Swadeshi movement, where traditional Indian art, 
                                      cultures and music was encouraged to be support. This, alongside
                                       the religious nature of the art form led artists to favour the 
                                       traditional art styles and most artisans stayed with using 
                                       traditional techniques in their own style.

                     <h2>Modern Day Production</h2>
                     <p>Pichhwai have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand 
                        among foreign visitors. The artists live mostly in Chitron ki gali (Street 
                        of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and are a 
                        close community with constant interaction. Often a pichhwai painting is a
                         group effort, where several skilful painters work together under the
                        supervision of a master artist.<br>
                        There has also been a push by other artists and designers to preserve and
                         showcase this art form to a wider, international audience. Designers have
                          utilised the traditional colours, printing techniques and pattern styles
                           associated pichhwai, in clothing attires and showcase them on international
                            platforms </p>
