<p>Warli painting is tribal art mostly created by the tribal people from the North Sahyadri Range in 
    Maharashtra, India. Warli paintings exist in cities such as Dahanu, Talasari, Jawhar, Palghar, 
    Mokhada, and Vikramgad of Palghar district, and originated in Maharashtra, where it is still
     practiced today.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="B">
        <div class="a"><h2><u>Tradition</u></h2>
            <p>The Warli painting tradition in Maharashtra are 
    among the finest examples of the folk style of paintings. The Warli tribe is one of the
    largest in India, located outside Mumbai. Till the 1970s, even though the tribal style
    of art is thought to date back as early as 10th century C.E.The Warli culture is 
    centered on the concept of Mother Nature and elements of nature are often focal points depicted 
    in Warli painting. Farming is their main way of life and a large source of food for the tribe. 
    They greatly respect nature and wildlife for the resources that they provide for life.Warli 
    artists use their clay huts as the backdrop for their paintings, similar to how ancient people 
    used cave walls as their canvases. <br>
    <u>Jivya Soma Mashe,</u> the artist in Thane district has played a great role in making the Warli 
    paintings more popular.</p>

    <h2>Painting technique</h2>
    <p>These rudimentary wall paintings use a set of basic geometric shapes: a circle, a triangle,
    and a square and also a set of colours usually consisting of brown and white . These shapes are 
    symbolic of different elements of nature. The circle and the triangle come from their observation
    of nature. The circle represents the sun and the moon, while the triangle depicts mountains and 
    conical trees. In contrast, the square renders to be a human invention, indicating a sacred 
    enclosure or a piece of land. The central motif in each ritual painting is the square, known as 
    the "chauk" or "chaukat", mostly of two types known as Devchauk and Lagnachauk. Inside a Devchauk 
    is usually a depiction of palghat, the mother goddess, symbolizing fraternity.<br>
    Male gods are unusual among the Warli and are frequently related to spirits which have taken 
    human shape. The central motif in the ritual painting is surrounded by scenes portraying hunting, 
    fishing, and farming, and trees and animals. Festivals and dances are common scenes depicted in
     the ritual paintings. People and animals are represented by two inverse triangles joined at
      their tips: the upper triangle depicts the torso and the lower triangle the pelvis. Their
       precarious equilibrium symbolizes the balance of the universe. The representation also has 
       the practical and amusing advantage of animating the bodies. Another main theme of Warli art 
       is the denotation of a triangle that is larger at the top, representing a man; and a triangle
        which is wider at the bottom, representing a woman.[better source needed] Apart from 
        ritualistic paintings, other Warli paintings covered day-to-day activities of the village
         people.

    <h2>Styles</h2>
    <p>One of the central aspects depicted in many Warli paintings is the tarpa dance. The tarpa, a
     trumpet-like instrument, is played in turns by different village men. Men and women entwine 
     their hands and move in a circle around the tarpa player. The dancers then follow him, turning 
     and moving as he turns, never turning their backs to the tarpa. The musician plays two different 
     notes, which direct the head dancer to either move clockwise or counterclockwise. The tarpa 
     player assumes a role similar to that of a snake charmer, and the dancers become the figurative
      snake. The dancers take a long turn in the audience and try to encircle them for entertainment.
       The circle formation of the dancers is also said to resemble the circle of life.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Materials used</h2>
    <p>The simple pictorial language of Warli painting is matched by a rudimentary technique. The 
    ritual paintings are usually created on the inside walls of village huts. The walls are made of a 
    mixture of branches, earth and red brick that make a red ochre background for the paintings. The
     Warli only paint with a white pigment made from a mixture of rice flour and water, with gum as a 
     binder. A bamboo stick is chewed at the end to give it the texture of a paintbrush. Walls are
      painted only to mark special occasions such as weddings, festivals or every thing harvests. 
      They make it with a sense that it can be seen by future generations.</p>

        <h2>In contemporary culture</h2>
        <p>The lack of regular artistic activity explains the traditional tribal sense of style for 
            their paintings. In the 1970s, this ritual art took a radical turn when Jivya Soma Mashe
             and his son Balu Mashe started to paint. They painted not for ritual purposes, but 
             because of their artistic pursuits. Jivya is known as the modern father of Warli 
             painting. Since the 1970s, Warli painting has moved onto paper and canvas.<br>
             Coca-Cola India launched a campaign featuring Warli painting in order to highlight the 
             ancient culture and represent a sense of togetherness. The campaign was called "Come Home
            on Deepawali" and specifically targeted the modern youth.The campaign included
            advertising on traditional mass media, combined with radio, the Internet, and out-of-home
             media.<br>
             The Manik Public School at Maniknagar, Karnataka, dedicated a large wall of their 
             academic block to preserve Indian heritage by hosting India's largest Warli art painting.
            Famous Warli artist Avanti Sandeep Kulkarni designed and hand-painted the school's 
            vision, values, and activities using the Warli culture and themes. Sections of painting
            were dedicated to showcasing Warli traditions. The India Book of Records recognized
            the record.</p>
            <h2>Traditional knowledge and intellectual property</h2>
            <p>Warli Painting is traditional knowledge and cultural intellectual property preserved 
      across generations. Understanding the urgent need for intellectual property rights, the tribal 
      non-governmental organization Adivasi Yuva Seva Sangh helped to register Warli painting 
      with a geographical indication under the intellectual property rights act.Various efforts 
      are in progress for strengthening sustainable economy of the Warli with social entrepreneurship.
